# simple-swiper
A proof-of-concept minimal code for swipeable content, built in JS.

I had to come with an idea for swipeable content for a project and since I had some spare time one sunday, I decided to build this.
The goal was to make a minimal example for swipeable content coming with buttons to change the page seen, working on both mobile and desktop (except IE) and without any external library.

You can see the demo [here](https://basilevu.github.io/simple-swiper/).
